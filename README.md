# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project

In fulfillment of the Coursera-John Hopkins University's module on Getting and Cleaning the Data, students are required to
work with untidy data from an experiment on Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset. The dataset is composed of
multiple related tables which represents computational value from the study.

The goal here is to make connection to these table and provide essential information specifically the mean of the activities 
conducted during the experiment. The untidy dataset can be accessed by accessing https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

The goal here is to put together 8 individual tables which are saved on a text file. Since the study was conducted on two 
different instance- test and train, it produces two sets of label and result.
